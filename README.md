# javaAlgorithms
I'm challenging myself to complete 100 different algorithms for 100 continuous days.
-- for the first few days i will be solving algorithms from the coding dojo algorithm challenges book

day 1)
*implemented a Node class and a LinkedList class
Algo1) RemoveDuplicates
**found in IntLinkedList Class**
Remove nodes with duplicate values.Retain only the first instance of each value.(singly linked list) 
  -Time Complexity: O(n^2)

day2)
failed at completing the algo of the day.(partition Singly Linked List)

day3)
algo2) isPalindrom
**found in StringAlgo class**
checks to see if a inputed word is a palindrom.


day4)
Made Node class a parent class to IntNode and StringNode classes.
Made LinkedList class a parent class to IntLinkedList and StringLinkedList classes.
algo(3) balancedParentheses
**found in StringAlgo class**
check to see if the input String has closing (,{,[ for every ),},]

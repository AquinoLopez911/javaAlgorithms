# javaAlgorithms
I'm challenging myself to complete 100 different algorithms for 100 continuous days.
-- for the first few days i will be solving algorithms from the coding dojo algorithm challenges book 
day 1)
*implemented a Node class and a LinkedList class

Algo1) Remove nodes with duplicate values.Retain only the first instance of each value.(singly linked list) 
  -Time Complexity: O(n^2)
  -could sort list and solve with O(n) Time Complexity

day2)
algo2)

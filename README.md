I'm challenging myself to complete 100 different algorithms for 100 continuous days.
-- for the first few days i will be solving algorithms from the coding dojo algorithm challenges book

day 1)
*implemented a Node class and a LinkedList class
Algo1) RemoveDuplicates
**found in LinkedList Class**
Remove nodes with duplicate values.Retain only the first instance of each value.(singly linked list) 
  -Time Complexity: O(n^2)

day2)
failed at completing the algo of the day.

day3)
algo2) isPalindrom
**found in RandomAlgo class**
checks to see if a inputed word is a palindrom.
